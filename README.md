3. Project Overview

The project aims to extract insights from restaurant data to identify patterns and relationships among various factors such as cuisine type, pricing, and ratings.

Objectives:

Understand restaurant distribution across cities and countries.

Identify the most popular and top-rated cuisines.

Analyze how pricing and delivery options impact customer ratings.

Examine the relationship between cost, votes, and overall restaurant performance.

Tools Used:

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

SQL: For analytical queries and aggregations

Power BI / Tableau: For dashboard and visualization

4. Data Analysis

The analysis was divided into multiple stages:

a. Data Cleaning

Removed missing or duplicate records.

Standardized city and cuisine names.

Converted columns to appropriate data types.

Created new fields such as “Primary Cuisine” and “Service Type.”

b. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of Restaurants: Count of restaurants by city and country.

Cuisine Analysis: Identified the most common and highest-rated cuisines.

Cost Analysis: Compared average cost and price range with rating levels.

Rating Insights: Analyzed rating color and text distribution to understand customer satisfaction levels.

Service Analysis: Compared restaurants with and without online delivery or table booking.

c. Visualization

Bar charts and histograms for rating and cost analysis.

Scatter plots for cost vs rating.

Maps showing restaurant distribution using latitude and longitude.

Interactive dashboards summarizing all key trends.

5. Key Findings

Indian and Italian cuisines were among the most popular across multiple cities.

Restaurants offering online delivery received more customer votes, indicating higher engagement.

The average cost for two people was not directly proportional to better ratings — even low-cost restaurants achieved high satisfaction scores.

Table booking availability correlated with slightly higher ratings, especially in premium price ranges.

Cities with the highest average ratings had a strong presence of diverse cuisines and delivery options.
